Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project is a wesbsite that allows users to learn more about colors. The user can click on one of the nine possible colors to look at possible meanings of colors. In the templates file, there is the main webpage, index.html, along with nine webpages for each color and images. There is also a scss and css file.
